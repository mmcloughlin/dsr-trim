/**
 * @file dsr-trim.c
 * @brief A tool for labeling and trimming SR proof certificates.
 * 
 *  `dsr-trim` checks deletion substitution redundancy (DSR) proofs and
 *  annotates them with unit propagation hints to form linear substitution
 *  redundancy (LSR) proofs, which can be checked by `lsr-check`.
 * 
 *  Roughly, DSR proofs are used to show that two propositional logic
 *  formulas are equisatisfiable, meaning that the original formula is
 *  satisfiable if and only if the derived formula is. DSR proofs do this
 *  by incrementally adding and deleting clauses from the formula. Added
 *  clauses must be redundant, i.e., adding them to the formula does not
 *  affect its satisfiability. In other words, a clause C is redundant
 *  with respect to formula F if formulas F and (F /\ C) are equisatisfiable.
 * 
 *  In most cases, DSR proofs are *unsatisfiability* proofs, meaning that
 *  the empty clause is eventually shown to be redundant. Since the empty
 *  clause is by definition unsatisfiable, this means that the original
 *  formula is unsatisfiable as well.
 * 
 *  In clausal proof systems generally, addition lines may contain witnesses
 *  that help the proof checker show that the clause is redundant. In SR,
 *  these witnesses are substitutions, which map variables to either true,
 *  false, or a literal. Intuitively, the substitution expresses how to
 *  "repair" the formula if a satisfying assignment for F doesn't satisfy C.
 * 
 *  This repository uses two distinct proof formats: DSR and LSR.
 *  DSR proofs only contain clauses and substitution witnesses, and so
 *  `dsr-trim` must perform unit propagation across the entire formula to
 *  derive hints. To do so, it maintains several data structures, such as
 *  a stack of unit literals/clauses and a record of which clauses were used
 *  in which UP derivations so that the number of hints may be minimized.
 * 
 *  More details can be found in the paper:

TODOs:
  - Candidate clause minimization. When marking clauses, mark literals as well.
  - Watch-pointer de-sizing. (i.e. fewer watch pointers de-size the wp array)
  - Double-check that get_clause_start() with deletions are used correctly.
      Don't want to use a deleted clause (more important for lsr-check).

Potential optimizations:
  - According to the profiler, a lot of time is spent in mark_dependencies,
      because all unit clauses must be iterated over. Instead, an array indexed
      by clauses could be maintained, and when a unit clause is involved in UP,
      its "unit_clauses" index is consulted to update a min/max value of clauses
      to mark in mark_dependencies. However, this probably won't work very well,
      because as mark_dependencies works, new clauses are marked.
  - Store the reduced clause in reduce_subst_mapped in an array. This would make
      RAT checks cheaper because rather than doing two loops over the clause,
      we can instead consult the cached substitution-mapped clause in the array.
  - Marijn's code computes the RAT set from the watch pointers. Might be more
    efficient than tracking the first/last.

 * @brief Undoes the effects of global unit propagation due to the implied unit
 *        clause at `from_index` being unit, in preparation for its deletion

 * 
 * When deleting an implied unit clause `C`, we need to do two things:
 * 
 *   1. Unassign unit literals dependent on `C` being unit.
 * 
 *   2. Re-run unit propagation after deleting `C`.
 * 
 * This function does (1) but does NOT do (2), i.e., it does not re-run
 * unit propagation.
 * 
 * Ideally, we would unassign only those unit clauses dependent on `C`,
 * but that analysis involves maintaining a list of dependencies. For
 * example, suppose implied unit clause `C1` depends on `C`. Then for
 * all later implied unit clauses, we need to check if that clause depends
 * on `C` OR `C1`, and this problem gets worse with each implied unit clause
 * that we unassign.
 * 
 * Thus, we do a coarse analysis: if the clause is a true unit, it is kept
 * in `unit_literals`/`unit_clauses`. Otherwise, it is unassigned by setting
 * it `alpha` timestamp to `0` and its `up_reasons` to `NO_UP_REASON`.
 * 
 * To save on time when re-running UP, we calculate and store the minimum
 * starting index for `global_up_literals_index`. In the worst case,
 * we must re-run UP from the beginning of the unit literals/clauses.
 * But since UP proceeds in rounds, then if `from_index` was derived
 * due to the `i`th round of UP, then we only need to re-run UP
 * from this `i`th round.
 * 
 * The values of `global_up_literals_index` and `units_size` are updated.
 *
 * @param from_index The 0-indexed clause ID into `unit_clauses` of the
 *                   implied unit clause that is about to get deleted.

/**
 * @brief Minimizes the witness and checks its consistency. Must be called
 *  after assuming the negation of the candidate clause and doing UP.
 * 
 * Any witness literal l set to true that is also set to true in alpha after
 * assuming the negation of the candidate clause and doing UP can be omitted.
 * This is because any clause satisfied by l will then generate contradiction
 * with alpha (alpha satisfies it), and any clause containing -l will, when
 * its negation is assumed for RAT checking, have no effect on alpha,
 * now that it contains -l after omitting l from the witness.
 * 
 * In addition, any literal l -> m in the substitution portion, with m set to
 * either true or false in alpha, can instead be mapped to m's truth value.
 * The reason this is allowed is similar to the above: any clause containing l
 * will contain m after the substitution, and m's truth value in alpha causes
 * the same overall effect as mapping l to m's truth value directly when
 * evaluating the clause under the substitution and doing RAT checking.
 * 
 * Minimization is done by a single loop over the witness. Unnecessary literals
 * l -> T/F are removed, and any l -> m in the substitution portion with
 * m -> T/F in alpha are set to l -> T/F. If l -> m is set to l -> T/F, we 
 * then check whether l can be removed using the same logic as before.
 * Removals are handled with an increasing "write pointer" that allows the
 * rest of the substitution to be shifted to fill in the holes.
 * 
 * Before returning, the global variable `witness_size` is set appropriately.
 * 
 * Note that l -> m set to l -> T/F stays in the substitution portion.
 * Printing must handle this case with a two-pass over the substitution portion.
 * 
 * A note on design:
 * We choose to do minimization this way because otherwise, careful bookkeeping
 * would have to be performed to shuffle the direct-mapped and subst mapped
 * portions around. Alternatively, we could use two separate arrays, but that
 * is bad for locality, and the witness is not usually minimized (that much).
 *

    When performing UP for backwards checking, we do a very similar thing
    to UP for forwards checking, except we skip unmarked clauses as possible
    unit clauses in favor of marked clauses (i.e., clauses that were involved
    in another UP derivation) in order to reduce the number of clauses we
    need in the formula to derive the empty clause.

    In the inner loop (j), any watch pointer with (j' < j) is either:
      - A satisfied clause, via its first watch pointer
      - A unit clause, made unit via its first watch pointer (which is then set to true)

    This is because if a clause is falsified, it generates a contradiction,
    and UP exits. If instead the first watch pointer is not satisfied, but
    the clause contains a non-falsified literal to replace the considered
    negated lit, then lit's watch pointer is removed.

    As a result, if we prefer marked clauses for UP, then circle back,
    the only clauses that "come before" will not have their truth values
    changed.

      (Lemma: when adding unit clauses/literals to be processed by UP,
        we will never have both (l) and (-l) waiting to be processed,
        since we already set the assignment.)

    As for clauses that "come after" our bookmarked spot, they will be one of:
      - A satisfied clause
      - A unit clause
      - An ignored, unmarked clause

    Repeating the UP loop on these clauses generates the following behavior:
      - Ignored (continue)
      - Ignored (since its watch pointer has been set to true, making it satisfied)
      - Actually do UP

    One solution is to "bubble up" the ignored unmarked clauses, i.e.,
    to "bubble down" the satisfied/unit clauses. One way to do this is
    to save the earliest ignored index, and then maintain the following invariant:

    | SAT | SAT | UNIT/SAT | ... | IGN | IGN | ... | new UNIT | ... |

    Then the index of the ignored clause in `wps_list[j]` increments by one,
    and the new unit/satisfied clause swaps with the earliest ignored clause:

    | SAT | SAT | UNIT/SAT | ... | new unit | IGN | ... | IGN | ... |

    This slightly changes the order of watch pointers within the list,
    which could be more expensive than simply doing the redundant thing.

    Running an experiment on packing.cnf gives about 5 billion SAT cases,
    and only 126 million UNIT cases, which makes not repeating the SAT
    cases a good thing to do, even if the swaps are expensive.

    This also means that we not only need to store the (i, j) pair of a bookmark,
    but we also need to store the (j' < j) index to swap ignored clauses with.
    (Thus, if i == i', then both j' and j need to be incremented, etc.)

      I think this means that we only have to set a bit if we ignored a clause
      during the j run for some i, save the (i, j) pair of the ignored, and
      restore it later

    Another interesting point: ignored clauses can be any type
    (SAT, UNIT, SWAP, CONTRA), we just don't know which one until we process.
    From that point, swapping can still occur, but the invariant from "before"
    is maintained, so we don't need to store anything special when processing,
    aside from setting the ignored bit to 0.

/**
 * @brief Assumes the negation of the candidate redundant clause into the
 *        current truth assignment, and then performs unit propagation.
 * 
 * This function performs a similar function to `assume_negated_clause()`
 * from `global_data.c`, but with extra bookkeeping.
 * 
 * The value of `up_state` must be `GLOBAL_UP` when calling this function.
 * On return, `up_state == CANDIDATE_UP`. Call `unassume_candidate_clause()`
 * to decrement the state and undo the effects of calling this function.
 * 
 * When we assume the negation of `clause_index`, we check how each literal
 * `l` evaluates under the truth assignment `alpha`. If `l` is unassigned,
 * then we assume it as a unit literal. If `l` evaluates to true, then
 * we have a trivial unit-propagation refutation, and we can compute the
 * refutation from the unit clause causing `l` to be true.
 * 
 * The tricky case is when `l` evaluates to false. Typically, we would ignore
 * `l`, since adding `-l` to `alpha` would have no effect. However, we also
 * want to minimize the number of unit-propagation hints in the LSR proof line
 * that we generate for this clause. One method of reducing the number of hints
 * is to treat `l` as a freshly-assumed literal, rather than the final literal
 * from a chain of unit-propagation-derived unit clauses. See
 * `mark_and_store_up_refutation()` for more information on how "assumed"
 * literals reduce the number of hints.
 * 
 * Thus, when `l` evaluates to false, we mark it as an "assumed" literal.
 * See the `MARK_AS_UP_ASSUMED_VAR()` macro for more information.
 * 
 * Note that no matter the returned result, the caller must call
 * `unassume_candidate_clause()`, since some or all of the clause's literals
 * may still be assumed in `alpha`.
 * 
 * TODO: Store which literal that causes `refuting_clause` to be set
 *       in order to find the shortest possible trivial UP refutation.
 * 
 * @param clause_index The candidate clause to assume.
 * @return `-1` if a contradiction was found and the UP refutation was emitted
 *         or stored, and `0` otherwise (meaning the assumption succeeded).
