/**
 * @file lsr-check.c
 * @brief A linear substitution redundancy checker, based on lpr-check.
 * 
 *  This tool checks linear substitution redundancy (LSR) proofs produced
 *  by the `dsr-trim` tool. LSR proofs are (roughly) used to show that two 
 *  propositional logic formulas are equisatisfiable, meaning that the
 *  original formula is satisfiable if and only if the derived formula is.
 *  LSR proofs do this by incrementally adding new clauses to the formula.
 *  The proof checker must determine that these clauses are redundant, meaning
 *  that adding them to the formula does not affect satisfiability.
 *  (In other words, that F and (F and C) are equisatisfiable.)
 *  When a chain of additions is shown to be redundant, then the two formulas
 *  are equisatisfiable.
 * 
 *  In most cases, LSR proofs are *unsatisfiability* proofs, meaning that
 *  the empty clause is eventually shown to be redundant. Since the empty
 *  clause is by definition unsatisfiable, this makes the original formula
 *  unsatisfiable as well.
 * 
 *  (LSR proofs may also include deletion lines, so a proof that does not
 *  show unsatisfiability may not show true equisatisfiability, since
 *  deleting a clause may make the formula satisfiable.)
 * 
 *  LSR proofs may be checked in linear time (with respect to the size of
 *  the proof and the formula) due to the presence of unit propagation (UP)
 *  hints, which indicate the next step in performing UP. These hints are
 *  added to DSR proofs by `dsr-trim`.
 * 
 *  All LRAT and LPR proofs are automatically LSR proofs, so `lsr-check`
 *  provides a superset of the functionality of similar checkers, such as
 *  `lrat-check`, `lpr-check`, and `cake_lpr`.
 * 
 *  At a high-level, `lsr-check` works as follows.
 * 
 *  After parsing a CNF formula, `lsr-check` checks LSR addition and deletion
 *  lines until either the empty clause is derived or until there are no
 *  more lines to check.
 * 
 *  Each addition line has the following form:
 * 
 *   <id> [clause] [witness] 0 [UP hints] [RAT hints] 0
 * 
 *  where:
 * 
 *  <id> is a 1-indexed line identifier. `lsr-check` requires these IDs to
 *  monotonically increase (although some other proof checkers allow
 *  the IDs to specify *any* deleted or non-existent clause)).
 *  Any unit propagation (UP) hints refer to the clause by this ID.
 * 
 *  [clause] is a list of literals in the candidate redundant clause.
 *  This clause may be empty. If so, then no witness or RAT hints can 
 *  be provided.
 * 
 *  [witness] is a substitution witness mapping literals to either 
 *  true or false; or from variables to other literals.
 * 
 *  [UP hints] and [RAT hints] are groups of clause IDs that guide
 *  unit propagation. Each group of RAT hints starts with the negative
 *  clause ID of the RAT clause to check.
 * 
 *  Deletion lines specify the clause IDs of the clauses to delete from
 *  the formula. This has the effect of making it easier and more efficient
 *  to show redundancy.
 * 
 *  `lsr-check` contains two parsing strategies: eager and streaming.
 *  When eagerly parsing, the entire proof is read into memory before
 *  proof checking begins. Otherwise, the proof is streamed (potentially from
 *  `stdin`), and the proof is checked as it is read. This can be used 
 *  to check very large proofs that cannot be written to disk.
 *
 *  More details can be found in `dsr-trim`, or in the paper:
